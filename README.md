# Komanda [http://komanda.io](http://komanda.io)

Komanda is a IRC client built with node-webkit, javascript, html and css for people who write code. The project goal is to build the best client for developers that use IRC for their projects, follow others or getting help on a new language or framework.

# Download (prebuilt binaries)

 * [Windows Latest Stable](http://komanda.io/stable/windows-current.zip)
 * [OS X Latest Stable](http://komanda.io/stable/mac-current.zip)
 * [Linux Latest Stable](http://komanda.io/stable/linux-current.zip)

# The Plan (in progress)

* Themeable and extensible with plugins.
* Load code snippets from gist.github.com, pastie, jsfiddle etc. (gist/jsfiddle added already)
* Search github/bitbucket for a repo based on the channel name.
* Import issues, wiki articles etc.
* [insert your ideas here] - Open an issue and i'll get to work.

# WTF are script codes?

Not a developer? No worries, it's still a great client!

* Themeable
* Clean & Simple UI
* Performant (pretty much - still working on making this better)

# BETA

Komanda is currently in beta. Things may not be perfect but it's pretty solid on the IRC side of things.
